Hi! My name is Mouhamed Sow. I am currently pursuing a diploma in computational engineering at IMT Atlantique, a `Grande Ã‰cole` in France.

Through this blog, I intend to share my insights and experiences as I learn deep learning with Fastai. I hope these reflections will be helpful to other learners.

English is not my first language, so please forgive any grammatical errors.
